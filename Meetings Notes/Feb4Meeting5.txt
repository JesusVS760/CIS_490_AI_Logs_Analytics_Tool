Attendance: Jesus Vazquez, Zyrus Tyson, Amany Fogg, Alexander Diep

Meeting Discussion:
We continued to work on the 9-week plan in small increments, utilizing our time well
We also made sure to revise the github repo to make it more structured.
We had also discussed our testing of the AI Tutor and what has and hasn't been effective such as how the AI Tutor had suddenly stalled in a prolonged loading state causing one of us users to close the software entirely in order for the AI Tutor to function again as desired.

Minutes Met: 40 minutes
